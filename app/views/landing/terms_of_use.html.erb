    <strong>Owners</strong>
    <br/>
    If, as an Owner, a booking is requested for your Space(s) through the Website you will be asked to approve or decline the Booking Request within the Booking Availability Period. If you choose to decline a Booking Request we will inform the Renter that there is no confirmed booking.

Within 2 business days following completion of the Booking and providing we have received payment details for the Owner, we will transmit payment to the Owner of the Booking Fee, less the Owner Fee.
  </p>
  <p>

    <strong>Renter Withdrawal</strong>

    A Renter may withdraw a Booking Request at any time before the Effective Time and ShareDining will cancel the Booking Request. Bookings cannot be cancelled by a Renter after the Effective Time other than with the consent of the Owner. In the event of such cancellation (and regardless of whether or not the Owner agrees to refund the Booking Fee to the Renter in the event of such cancellation), the Renter Fee on the Booking Fee will be payable to ShareDining and will not be refunded to the Renter.

    An Owner may cancel a Booking up until the commencement of the Booking. If an Owner cancels a Booking after the Effective Time (an <strong>Owner Cancellation</strong>), ShareDining will refund the Booking Fee and the Renter Fee to the Renter for such Booking within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation. In the event of an Owner Cancellation, the Owner will be liable to ShareDining for the Owner Fee and Renter Fee (together the <strong>Owner Cancellation Charge</strong>).

    In certain circumstances, ShareDining may decide in its absolute discretion, that it is necessary to cancel a Booking (for example, but not in any way limited to, reasons of security, criminal activity or following an event that is outside ShareDining’s control). Renters and Owners agree that ShareDining will not have any liability for any such cancellation and neither Renter Fee nor Owner Fee will be payable in the event of such a cancellation.
